!*    PURPOSE.
!     --------

!       THIS PROGRAM SUPERVISES THE EXECUTION OF THE WAM MODEL.

!**   INTERFACE.
!     ----------

!       IN ORDER FOR THE WAM MODEL TO EXECUTE, IT NEEDS
!       FILES FROM ESSENTIALLY FIVE SOURCES.

!       1. THE UNFORMATED FILES CREATED BY THE JOB PREPROC

!       2. USER INPUT FILE

!       3. THE WIND INPUT FILE.

!       4  THE BOUNDARY VALUE INPUT FILES CREATED BY JOB BOUINT.
!          THESE FILES ARE DYNAMICALLY ASSIGNED.

!       5. THE START FILES:
!          THE RESTART FILES HAVE TO BE CREATED BY JOB
!          PRESET, IF A COLD START HAS TO BE DONE.
!          THESE FILES OR FILES FROM A PREVIOUS MODEL RUN
!          ARE AUTOMATICALLY ASSIGNED. (SEE SUB GSFILE).

!       EXPLANATIONS FOR ALL FILES ARE GIVEN IN DETAIL IN SUB INITMDL

!     LIBRARIES.
!     ----------

!         NONE.

!     METHOD.
!     -------

!       THIS VERSION OF THE WAM MODEL HAS BEEN PRODUCED
!       BY MERGING AND CORRECTLY INTERFACING WHAT USED
!       TO BE THE STAND ALONE PROGRAMS:
!               PREWIND AND THE WAM MODEL.
!       PREWIND REFORMATS WINDS INTO THE WAM MODEL BLOCKED
!       STRUCTURE.  STARTING WITH THE INITIAL SEA STATE
!       FILES, THE WAM MODEL CAN THEN INTEGRATE FORWARD
!       IN TIME, DRIVEN BY THE REFORMATTED WINDS.
!       THE SEA STATE AND RESULT FILES ARE SAVED IN REGULAR
!       INTERVALLS. THE SEA STATE FILE SERVE AS THE INITIAL
!       CONDITION FOR A RESTART.

!       EACH CALL OF THE SUB WAVEMDL INTEGRATES FORWARD IN
!       TIME BY ONE WIND INPUT TIMESTEP OR ONE PROPAGATION
!       TIMESTEP, WHAT EVER IS LONGER.
!       IN THE FIRST CALL TO WAVEMDL AN INITIALIZATION IS
!       DONE IN ADDITION.

!     EXTERNALS.
!     ----------

!       *WAVEMDL*   - SUPERVISES THE OVERALL FLOW THROUGH
!                     THE MAIN MODULES: INITMDL, PREWIND
!                     AND WAMODEL.

!     REFERENCE.
!     ----------

!       EACH MODULE IS OF ITSELF THOROUGHLY DOCUMENTED.
